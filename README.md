SpriteSpin jQuery Plugin
=====================================================
This plugin enables spriteanimation on your website. It requires a series of 
images stiched together into a single spritesheet and is able to play these 
images frame by frame which results in an animation. The aim of this plugin is
to provide a 360Â° view of some kind of product. There is no flash needed, 
everything is done with javascript and the jQuery framework.

Requirements
=====
The only requirement is the jQuery core framework. The plugin is tested with
jQuery-1.4.2. Optional requirement is the jQuery-ui framework in order you want
to control the animation by using a slider.

Usage
=====
Create a container on your site where you want the animation to show up

  <div id="spritespin"/>
  
In your javascript fire the plugin on that container

  $("#spritespin").spritespin([options]);
  
Options
=====
* **width** The width of a single frame. Default is 640.
* **height** The height of a single frame. Default is 480.
* **frames** Total number of frames. Default os 36.
* **frame** Initial frame number. Default is 0.
* **animate** If true, starts the animation after initialize. Default is false.

Related work
=====
Same functionality is provided by the reel plugin http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel
However, this does not perform well in firefox. Since firefox is one of the
widely used browsers i wrote the plugin from scratch. Unfortunately this plugin
also has its drawbacks, see known issues.

Known Issues
=====
* Opera browser plays only the half of the animation. Still working on that.
* Chrome browser performs bad during animation. Working on that too.
